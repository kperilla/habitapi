# Design

## User Stories
- As a growing dev, I want the app to use CI/CD best practice to learn more about them
- As a developer, I want good documentation, diagrams, and an OpenAPI spec, to keep things well-ordered and well-designed
- As a user, I want the API to store my historical habit data, to view the accumulation
- As a user, I want to be able to log in to see my own stats/data
- As a user, I want to be able to store habit points/acts and store rewards, to be able to see my progress
- As a designer and user, I want a simple system of points that relate to habit
actions, so that users are not discouraged or confused
- As a user/frontend, I want to be able to see my own stats/data with an endpoint, so that I can display them
- As a user, I want to be able to update or delete older entries, so that I can fix mistakes
- As a user, I want to be able to group related habits, so that they are organized
- As a designer, I want to have a recommendation for a cap on daily points to encourage a healthy progress
- As a user, I want to be able to ignore above recommendation if I want to
- As a user, I want to be able to have helpful tips, so that I can improve their habits
- As a user, I want a periodic digest of tips and help made by gen AI, to help with habits
- As a consumer, I may want a GraphQL API for historical data, to be able to get specific subsets of the data

## Specific Design

### Tech Stack
- Go REST API (TODO: look into best)
- DB
  - TODO: sql or nosql?
- CI/CD with GHA
- Hosted on GCP
- Domain: whatever is cheapest
- Kubernetes to define deployment

### API Design

REST API with the following endpoints:

- /habits - full CRUD
- /habit-group - full CRUD
- /deeds - full CRUD
- /rewards - full CRUD
- /users - full CRUD
- /data - GET
  - TODO: Need to see how best to deliver historical data; GraphQL?

### DB Design

#### Relationships
- Users (1:*) HabitGroups, Habits, Deeds, Rewards
- HabitGroups (1:*) Habits
- Habits (1:*) Deeds

#### Possible Schema
Needing Habits along with HabitGroup seem to be the most common connection,
so it seems like having HabitGroup be it's own collection is ideal, rather than
embedding it.
User
```
{
    id,
    name,
    point_total,
}
```

HabitGroup
```
{
    id,
    name,
    description,
    user_id: REF[User]
}
```

Habit
```
{
    id,
    habit_group_id: REF[HabitGroup],
    user,
    name,
    description
}
```

Deed
```
{
    id,
    timestamp,
    user_id: REF[User],
    name,
    description,
    habit_id: REF[Habit]
}

```

Reward
```
{
    id,
    user_id: REF[User],
    point_cost,
    name,
    description
}
```
